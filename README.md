This API can help your webshop to create a "lottery" sort of game for your users.
The API can choose randomly one of your users in a particular time of the day, and it sends
a mail for that user with the details of the price and sends back the winners email address for you (the webshop-owner).

The API needs to get a JSON object with the all the email addressess (key) and names (value) of your users.
